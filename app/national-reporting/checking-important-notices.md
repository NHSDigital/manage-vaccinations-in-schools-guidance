You can see if there are any important notices that you need to be aware of on the Mavis national reporting dashboard.

Examples of important notices include:

- records flagged as invalid if a child has no NHS number or 2 NHS numbers, for example, in cases of adoption
- records flagged as sensitive, for example, if a child is in witness protection or if there’s an ongoing police investigation
- child vaccinated under Gillick competence and said not to notify their parents
- child is deceased

Once you have seen and, if necessary, acted on an important notice, you can dismiss it.

If you dismiss an important notice it will disappear from the **Import** page for all superusers in your team. It will still be visible on the child’s vaccination record.
