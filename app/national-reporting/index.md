Mavis national reporting was developed by an NHS England team working closely with SAIS staff to make it as effective as possible.

Using the national reporting service you can:

- upload and import vaccination records to be automatically shared with NHS England
- find children, view and edit their uploaded vaccination records

We want this guide to be as useful as possible. If you’d like to suggest an improvement or give feedback about the guide, contact us at england.mavis@nhs.net.
