## Flu and HPV

Mavis national reporting automatically shares imported flu and HPV vaccination records with GP practices.

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid duplication, you should also tell your CHIS provider that they do not need to send flu and HPV vaccination records to GP practices because Mavis national reporting does this automatically.

### When a child asks for confidentiality

If a child self-consented for a vaccination under Gillick competence and asked for their parents not to be informed, you must not upload their record to Mavis national reporting. 

You must share the record with the child’s GP manually.

## All other vaccination programmes

You still need to share records of MenACWY, Td/IPV, MMR or MMRV vaccinations manually.
