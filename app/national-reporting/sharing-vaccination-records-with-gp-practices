## Flu and HPV

Mavis national reporting automatically shares imported flu and HPV vaccination records with GP practices.

You do not need to tell them about these vaccinations, except in some cases of self-consent - see [Checking important notices](/national-reporting/checking-important-notices/).

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid duplication, you should also tell your CHIS provider that they do not need to send flu and HPV vaccination records to GP practices because Mavis national reporting does this automatically.

## All other vaccination programmes

You still need to share records of MenACWY, Td/IPV, MMR or MMRV vaccinations manually.
