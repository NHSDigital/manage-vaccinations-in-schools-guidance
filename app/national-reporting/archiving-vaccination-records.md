> [!NOTE]
> Only superusers can archive vaccination records. You can ask a superuser in your group to archive a record.

You may need to remove a vaccination record by archiving it, for example, if a record appears twice due to a technical error or if historical vaccinations were matched incorrectly.

If you archive a record, it will be deleted from the child’s GP’s records and from NHS England records.

To archive a record:

1. Find the vaccination record by searching for the child’s name or NHS number on the **Children** tab.
2. Click on the child’s name.
3. Select the vaccination you need to archive by clicking the date.
4. Select **Archive vaccination record** at the bottom of the vaccination details card.
5. Confirm by selecting **Yes, archive this vaccination record**.
