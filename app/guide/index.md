Mavis is a digital tool designed to help school age immunisation service (SAIS) teams manage their vaccination programmes end to end.

It has been built by an NHS England team working closely with SAIS staff and parents, to make it as effective as possible.

Mavis aims to remove the problems of system fragmentation and manual data entry, as well as improving data quality and vaccine uptake.
