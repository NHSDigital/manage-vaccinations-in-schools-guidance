When a new file upload (of a cohort or class list) or a consent response indicates that a child has changed school, Mavis will raise this change on the **School moves** page so it can be reviewed before being applied to the childâ€™s record.

1. Go to **School moves** in the main navigation.
2. Click **Review** against a school move.
3. Check the information provided: the new school is shown on the left with the updated information highlighted.
4. Confirm or ignore the change of school for each child as appropriate.
