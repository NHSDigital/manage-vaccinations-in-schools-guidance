    key: Preparing for a new school year
---

The month of August is when we prepare for the next school year.

In this period you can see 2 school years in the Mavis filters so you can decide whether to view or manage records for the previous school year or the next one.

From 1 August you can:
- import new cohorts that were not already in Mavis - you only need to import the new cohort, all the others are already in Mavis (when you upload a cohort or class list, make sure the YEAR_GROUP column in the CSV file shows the school year the child will be in from 1 September)
- check cohorts and any important notices
- review school moves - see [Reviewing school moves](/guide/school-moves.md)
- schedule sessions - at least the sessions due to take place in the next month need to be scheduled in Mavis so that consent invitations can go out to parents in time - see [Scheduling and editing sessions](/guide/sessions.md)
- invite some children to clinics, for example if they are immunosuppressed and need to be prioritised for flu vaccination - see [Vaccinating in community clinics](/guide/community-clinics.md)

All consent, triage, and PSD results expire at the end of each school year so you will need to add this information again in the new school year.

Any children who are eligible for vaccination but have moved to a year group not supported by their school (for example Year 6 children moving to year 7 or children leaving middle schools) will be automatically assigned to community clinic sessions (until you upload the new cohort).

Children who have aged out of programmes (such as Year 12 or Year 15 in SEN schools) will no longer be shown in the list of child records in Mavis, but you can choose to include those children through **Advanced filters**.
