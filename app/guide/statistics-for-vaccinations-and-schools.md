The **Reports** area of Mavis lets you:

- view vaccination data for children and schools in your area
- download vaccination reports to share with CHIS, GP practices or others

To get there, select **Reports** from the Mavis homepage or the top navigation bar.

## Vaccinations dashboard

The vaccinations dashboard shows live statistics for the current academic year for all eligible children in your area.

You can see:

- the total number of children in the cohort
- how many children have been vaccinated for each programme (by any provider)
- how many vaccinations your team gave each month

You can use filters to view data for specific programmes, genders and year groups.

> [!NOTE]
> We define **cohort** as all children who are eligible for the vaccine according to their academic year group, whether or not they have already been vaccinated.
