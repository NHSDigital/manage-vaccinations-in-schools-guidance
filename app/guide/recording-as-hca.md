If you’re a healthcare assistant, only children who have had a PSD added by a prescriber will appear in the Record vaccinations area of Mavis.

1. Go to the relevant session in Mavis.
2. Go to the **Record vaccinations** tab. 

You’ll see a list of all children who have had a PSD added by a prescriber and are ready to be vaccinated. The vaccination method is shown clearly as nasal spray. You can record nasal spray vaccinations for these children.
