You can register children’s attendance at vaccination sessions using the Register tab while a session is in progress. 

If this feature is enabled for your team, you can only record vaccinations for children who are registered as attending a session.

This feature can be switched off. In that case, all children with consent (and ‘safe to vaccinate’ triage outcomes, where relevant) will appear in ‘Record vaccinations’. 

To register children’s attendance or absence:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **In Progress** sessions.
3. Click on the name of the school you’re attending.
4. Click on the **Register** tab.
5. You’ll see a list of all children for this session - you can use the ‘Not registered yet’ filter if you only want to see children who have not been registered yet.
6. Find the child’s name, then click on the **Attending** or **Absent** button.

You can update a child’s attendance status if you need to, while the session is in progress.

1. From the **Register** tab, find the child whose attendance you want to update.
2. Click on the child’s name to open their record.
3. Click on the ‘Update attendance’ link near the top of the page.
4. Update their attendance status, then save your changes.
