You can only record vaccinations for children who are registered as attending a session.

To register children as attending or absent, the session must be in progress.

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Today** tab.
3. Click on the name of the school you’re attending.
4. Click on the **Register** tab.
5. You’ll see a list of all children for this session - you can use the ‘Not registered yet’ filter if you only want to see children who have not been registered yet.
6. Find the child’s name, then click on the **Attending** or **Absent** button.

2. Click on the child’s name to open their record.
