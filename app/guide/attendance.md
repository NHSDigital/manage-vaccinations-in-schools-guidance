To register children as attending or absent:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Today** tab.
3. Click on the name of the school youâ€™re attending.
4. Click on **Register attendance**.

When you mark a child as attending or absent, the **Status** on the record will indicate the next required action for the child.
