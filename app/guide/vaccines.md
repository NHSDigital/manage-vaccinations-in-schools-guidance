To add a vaccine batch:

1. From the dashboard, go to **Vaccines**.
2. Find the relevant vaccine type and select **Add a new batch**.
3. Enter the batch ID and expiry date, then click on **Add batch**.

## Archiving batches

When all vaccines in a batch have been used, or the batch has expired, you should archive it. Archiving a batch removes it from the list of vaccines nurses can select when recording vaccinations.

To archive a batch:

1. From the dashboard, go to **Vaccines**.
2. Find the relevant vaccine type and batch ID and select **Archive**.
3. Select **Confirm**.

Once a batch has been archived, you cannot undo this.

Batches are not archived automatically. You must archive each batch manually.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot edit vaccine batches in Mavis. If there’s a mistake in the batch number or expiry date, archive the batch and add a new one with the correct information
