5. To work through the **Triage needed** tab, click on the name of the child whose record you want to triage.
6. Review the parent’s answers to health questions.
7. Use the radio buttons to indicate whether you think it’s safe to vaccinate the child. You can also add notes to a triage decision if needed.
