    key: Sharing consent forms with schools
---

If schools have not provided parents’ contact details, they’ll need to send out consent requests and consent reminders that you’ve provided them with.

### Consent request templates

- [Flu consent request email](/email-templates/consent-request-flu)
- [Flu consent reminder email](/email-templates/consent-reminder-flu)
- [HPV consent request email](/email-templates/consent-request-hpv)
- [HPV consent reminder email](/email-templates/consent-reminder-hpv)
- [MenACWY and Td/IPV consent request email](/email-templates/consent-request-doubles)
- [MenACWY and Td/IPV consent reminder email](/email-templates/consent-reminder-doubles)

### How to use the templates

You will need to add the correct dates and a URL for the consent form yourselves. **This URL is different for every school.**

You’ll also need to let the schools know when they should send the different messages.

To get the URL for the consent form:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **Scheduled** sessions.
3. Click on the link for the relevant school.
4. On the right side of the page, you’ll see links for the consent forms for the different vaccination programmes.
5. If you click on this link, you will get the URL you need to use in the email template.
