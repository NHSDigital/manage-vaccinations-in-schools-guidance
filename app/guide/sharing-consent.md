title: Sharing consent forms with schools who haven’t provided contact details
order: 4
---

If schools haven’t provided parents’ contact details, they’ll need to send out consent requests and consent reminders that you’ve provided them with.

- Copy of consent request [link to separate page with initial consent request]
- Copy of consent reminder [link to separate page with consent reminder]

You will need to add the correct dates and URL for the consent form yourselves. This URL is different for every school.

You’ll also need to let the schools know when they should send the different messages.

To get the URL for the consent form:

- Go to Sessions
- Go to the Scheduled tab
- Click on the link for the relevant school
- On the right side of the page, you’ll see a link for the consent form [screenshot here]
- If you click on this link, you will get the URL you need to use in the email template
