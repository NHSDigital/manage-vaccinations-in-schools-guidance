To record vaccinations in Mavis, you need to have internet access. If you know the school you’re visiting doesn’t have a reliable internet connection, you should prepare to record offline. This involves downloading a spreadsheet while you still have internet access.

To prepare to work offline:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Scheduled** tab.
3. Click the link for the school you’re interested in.
4. Click on the **Record offline** link at the top of the page.
5. Enter your name and then click on **Download spreadsheet**.
6. Save this locally.
7. Fill it in during the session.

Once you have a reliable internet connection again, you can upload the spreadsheet in the **Vaccinations** area of the relevant programme.
