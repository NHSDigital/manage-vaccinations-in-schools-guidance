Most teams currently handle clinic bookings outside Mavis. However, you can use Mavis to:
- invite parents to book a clinic appointment through your local booking service
- record vaccinations given in clinics

### Inviting children who belong to a school but who have not been vaccinated in a school session

Some children may have missed being vaccinated at a school session, for example if they were ill or on holiday at the time of the session.

To send clinic invitations to children who belong to a school, but were not vaccinated there:

1. Go to the sessions for schools that you are not going to return to in this vaccination programme
2. In each school session, go to the **Send clinic invitations** link. This will show you a summary of how many invitations will be sent out
3. Click the **Send clinic invitations** button

Mavis will send the invitations the next day. Note that there are no automatic reminders for clinic invitations.

### Inviting or moving individual children to clinic sessions

You can invite children to clinics or move them instantly to a clinic session by using the ‘Invite to community clinic’ button at the bottom of the child’s record.

The ‘Invite to community clinic’ button has 2 functions.

1. If you need to invite a child to a clinic (for example, if they are immunosuppressed and need to be prioritised for a flu vaccination, or you were unable to vaccinate them in a school session) click the button and an invitation will go out to the parents the next day.
2. If a child turns up at a clinic and is not on today’s session list, click the button and the child will be added to the session. If you vaccinate the child, no invitation will be sent.

### If the child is home-schooled or their school is unknown

To send clinic invitations to parents of children who are home-schooled, or where the school is unknown, you need to:
1. Go to the **Schools** tab. 
2. Find **No known school (including home schooled children)** in the list of schools.
3. Click on **Send clinic invitations** in the top left of the screen

If you do this more than once, parents will receive duplicate invitations, so make sure you coordinate with the rest of your team about when to send these invitations.

If you’re not sure who has been invited to a clinic, you can check using the **Invited to clinic** filter in the Schools view for **No known school (including home schooled children)**.

## Getting consent to vaccinate

You do not necessarily need to get consent in advance for clinics. If a parent accompanies a child to the clinic, their presence is considered implied consent.

If you choose to seek consent in advance, once a parent has booked a clinic slot through your local booking system:

1. In the **Community clinic** page, go to the **Children** tab and filter for **Needs consent**.
2. Click into the child’s record and scroll down.
3. Click on **Send consent request**.

This will trigger an email to the parent or guardian.

You could also try to get consent over the phone. To do this:

1. In the **Community clinic** page, go to the **Children** tab and filter for **Needs consent**.
2. Click into the child’s record.
3. Click on **Record a new consent response**.
4. Phone the parent and work through the consent flow to record their response in Mavis.
