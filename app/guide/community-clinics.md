title: Inviting children to community clinics
group: Sessions
order: 37
---

Children will be added to the cohort for community clinics if:

- they are shown as being homeschooled in the nominal role
- their school is unknown
- they don't receive a vaccination in school

To create dates for community clinics:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Unscheduled** tab.
3. Go to the **Community clinic** link.
4. Click on **Schedule sessions**.
5. Follow the process as you would for school sessions.

To add or amend dates for community clinics:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Scheduled** tab.
3. Go to the **Community clinic** link (there is just one for all clinics).
4. Go to **Edit session**.
5. Follow the process as you would for school sessions.

Once a child is added to the cohort for community clinics, their parent or guardian will receive an email (and potentially a text) inviting them to book a clinic slot through Swiftqueue. This email will either go out three weeks before the date of the first clinic scheduled, or immediately if they’re added to the cohort less than three weeks before the date of the first clinic.

To check whether an invitation email has been sent:

1. Go to **Check consent responses**.
2. In the **No response** tab, click on the name of a child to view the child record.
3. Click on **Activity log**.

Once a parent has booked a clinic slot through Swiftqueue, you need to make sure you have consent to vaccinate the child.

If you do not have consent, you need to manually send a consent request. To do this:

1. In the **Community clinic** page, go to **Check consent responses**.
2. Click into the child’s record and scroll down.
3. Click on **Send consent request**.

This will trigger an email to the parent or guardian.

You could also try to get consent over the phone. To do this:

1. In the **Community clinic** page, go to Check consent responses.
2. Click into the child’s record and scroll down.
3. Click on **Get consent** response.
4. Phone the parent and record their response in Mavis.
