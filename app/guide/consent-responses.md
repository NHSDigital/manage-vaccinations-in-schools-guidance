Mavis lets you review consent responses for each session.

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **Scheduled** sessions.
3. Select the relevant location.
4. Go to the **Consent** tab.
5. Use the filters to see how many consents, refusals and conflicts you have - a list of children matching the filters you’ve used will display.
6. Click on a child’s name if you want to see more details about consent for that child.

For flu, if consent has been given, you’ll be able to see whether this is for:

- nasal spray only
- nasal spray, or injected vaccine if the nasal spray is not suitable
- injected vaccine only

## Reviewing children who’ve changed schools

When a parent submits a consent response, they can also let Mavis know that a child’s school has changed.

To review a child changing school, follow the instructions on this page of the user guide:

- [Reviewing school moves](/guide/school-moves)

## Reviewing unmatched consent responses

1. Go to the top-level **Unmatched responses** page.
2. Try to match an unmatched consent response with an existing record first by clicking on **Match**.
3. Look for a child in the cohort that matches the consent response. You can search by name or date of birth.
4. If you think you’ve found a match, click on the child's name. This will display details from the consent response next to details from the child record.

5. If you believe it is a match, click **Link response with record**.
6. If you cannot find a match, you can go back to the **Responses** page and click **Create new record** to create a new child record.

## Investigating conflicting consent

If one parent gives consent for a vaccination and the other refuses, Mavis flags this as conflicting consent.

For flu, ‘conflicting consent’ can also mean that one parent has given consent for the nasal spray only and the other has given consent for the injected vaccine only.

In both cases, you will need to investigate the conflicting consent and resolve it before the child can be vaccinated.

1. From the **Consent** tab of a session page, filter for **Conflicting consent**.
2. If you click on the child’s record and scroll down, you’ll see who has said what in their consent responses.
3. Click on the name of the parent whose consent you want to investigate.
4. You can either mark that response as invalid (exercise caution here), or you can follow-up with the parent by returning to the child’s record to see the parent’s contact details.
5. If the parent changes their consent decision when you speak to them, you’ll need to add their new response to the child record manually (see ['Getting verbal consent'](/guide/verbal-consent.md)).
