2. Use the actions list to either confirm or ignore the move.

## Reviewing unmatched consent responses

1. Go to the top-level **Responses** page.
2. Try to match an unmatched consent response with an existing record first by clicking on **Match with record**.
3. Look for a child in the cohort that matches the consent response. You can search by name or postcode.
4. If you think you’ve found a match, click the **Select** action for the child.

5. If you believe it is a match, click **Link response with record**.
6. If you cannot find a match, you can go back to the **Responses** page and click **Create record** to create a new child record.

## Recording verbal consent from a parent before a session starts

1. From the **Check consent responses** page, go into the **No response** tab.
2. Go to into a child record by clicking on their name.
3. Scroll down and select **Get consent response**.
4. Use the radio button to indicate who you’re trying to get consent from (you can add a new contact if necessary).
5. Call the parent.
6. Record their response.
7. Check and confirm their answers, and select **Save changes**.

## Investigating conflicting consent

1. From the **Check consent responses** page, go into the **Conflicts** tab.
2. If you click on the child’s record and scroll down, you’ll see who has said what in their consent responses.
3. Click on the name of the parent who refused.
4. You can either mark that response as invalid (exercise caution here), or you can follow-up with the parent by returning to the child's record to see the parent’s contact details.
5. When speaking to the refuser, if they now give consent, you’ll need to go through the "Get consent response" flow over the phone.
