Mavis lets you review consent responses for each session.

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Scheduled** tab.
3. Click the link for the school you’re interested in.
4. Go to the **Consent** tab.
5. Use the filters to see how many consents, refusals and conflicts you have - a list of children matching the filters you’ve used will display.
6. Click on a child’s name if you want to see more details about consent for that child.

## Reviewing children who’ve changed schools

When a parent submits a consent response, they can also let Mavis know that a child’s school has changed.

To review a child changing school, follow the instructions on this page of the user guide:

* [Reviewing school moves](/guide/school-moves)


## Reviewing unmatched consent responses

1. Go to the top-level **Unmatched responses** page.
2. Try to match an unmatched consent response with an existing record first by clicking on **Match**.
3. Look for a child in the cohort that matches the consent response. You can search by name or date of birth.
4. If you think you’ve found a match, click on the child's name. This will display details from the consent response next to details from the child record.

5. If you believe it is a match, click **Link response with record**.
6. If you cannot find a match, you can go back to the **Responses** page and click **Create new record** to create a new child record.

## Investigating conflicting consent

1. From the **Consent** tab of a session page, filter for **Conflicting consent**.
2. If you click on the child’s record and scroll down, you’ll see who has said what in their consent responses.
3. Click on the name of the parent who refused.
4. You can either mark that response as invalid (exercise caution here), or you can follow-up with the parent by returning to the child’s record to see the parent’s contact details.
5. When speaking to the refuser, if they now give consent, you’ll need to add their consent to the child record manually (see 'Recording verbal consent from a parent before a session starts', above).
