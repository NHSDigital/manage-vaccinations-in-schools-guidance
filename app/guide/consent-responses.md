1. Go to **Review unmatched consent responses**.
2. Try to match with an existing record first by clicking on Match with record.
3. Search by name or postcode.
4. If you think you’ve found a match, click on the child’s name.
5. If you believe it is a match, click **Link response with record**.
6. If you cannot find a match, you can go back to the **Review unmatched consent responses** page and create a new child record.

## Sending ad-hoc reminders

1. From the **Check consent responses** page, go into the **No response** tab
2. Go to into a child record by clicking on their name
3. Make sure a reminder hasn’t been sent recently (Mavis will tell you if one has)
4. Click on **Send reminder**

Note that it’s not currently possible to send ad-hoc reminders in bulk.

## Recording verbal consent from a parent before a session starts

1. From the **Check consent responses** page, go into the **No response** tab.
2. Go to into a child record by clicking on their name.
3. Scroll down and select **Get consent response**.
4. Use the radio button to indicate who you’re trying to get consent from (you can add a new contact if necessary).
5. Call the parent.
6. Record their response.
7. Check and confirm their answers, and select **Save changes**.

## Adding a note to a refusal

1. From the **Check consent responses** page, go into the **Refused** tab. You can see the reasons for refusal listed here.
2. To add a note, go to the Consent response card at the bottom of the screen and click on the parent’s name.
3. Click on **Add notes** and then leave any relevant notes before saving.

## Investigating conflicting consent

1. From the **Check consent responses** page, go into the **Conflicts** tab.
2. If you click on the child’s record and scroll down, you’ll see who has said what in their consent responses.
3. Click on the name of the parent who refused.
4. You can either mark that response as invalid (exercise caution here), or you can click on **Follow up** to see the parent’s contact details.
5. Once you’ve spoken to the refuser, use the radio buttons to indicate whether their original decision stands or not.
6. If they now give consent, you’ll need to go through a consent flow over the phone.
