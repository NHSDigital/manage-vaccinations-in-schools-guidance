## Downloading a paper-based consent form

If you receive a request to send a parent a paper-based consent form, you:

1. Go to **Sessions**, then the **Scheduled** tab.
2. Find the relevant school.
3. On the school page, click on the **Download consent form** link for the relevant vaccination programme.
4. You can then print the form off and send it to the parent who requested it.
