## Downloading a paper-based consent form

If you receive a request to send a parent a paper-based consent form, you can download and print the relevant form from Mavis.

1. Go to **Sessions**, then filter for **Scheduled** sessions.
2. Select the relevant location.
3. On the school page, click on the **Download consent form** link for the relevant vaccination programme.
4. You can then print the form off and send it to the parent who requested it.

Once the parent returns the form, you can enter the information given into Mavis using the 'Record a new consent response' flow.

2. Go to into a child record by clicking on their name.
3. Select **Record a new consent response**.
4. Use the radio button to indicate whoâ€™s responded.
5. Go through the consent flow, making sure to select **Paper** as the way the response was given.
