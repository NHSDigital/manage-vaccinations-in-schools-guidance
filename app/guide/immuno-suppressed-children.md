    key: Vaccinating immuno-suppressed children with HPV vaccine
---

After the first dose, Mavis won’t automatically include immuno-suppressed children in additional HPV school sessions or clinics.

Mavis won’t automatically let parents know that their child needs a second or third HPV dose, or where to get it.

Mavis can be used to get consent from the parent for the first vaccination, and the consent can be viewed in the global patient view for doses 2 and 3.

Do not record second or third vaccinations for immuno-suppressed children in Mavis. You should record them offline in a spreadsheet and then import the records into Mavis.
