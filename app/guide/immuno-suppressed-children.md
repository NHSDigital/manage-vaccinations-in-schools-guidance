    key: Handling HPV vaccinations for immunosuppressed children
---

Children who are immunosuppressed should have 3 doses of the HPV vaccine over a 12 month period.

You can use Mavis in the usual way to:

- get consent for the first dose of the HPV vaccine
- record the vaccination

After the first dose, Mavis will not automatically include immunosuppressed children in additional school sessions or clinics.

Mavis will not let parents know that their child needs a second or third dose, or where to get it.

The consent that was given for the first vaccination will remain on the child’s record in Mavis, and will be valid for subsequent doses of the vaccine.

As you cannot add children who need second or third doses to upcoming sessions in Mavis, you should:

1. Invite the child to the relevant session by phone or email (you’ll also need to confirm health information for the child).
2. Record the additional HPV dose in a spreadsheet, offline.
3. Upload the spreadsheet into Mavis - this will import the new HPV vaccination to the child’s record.

> [!NOTE]
> Mavis does not currently distinguish between first, second or third doses of the HPV vaccine, so each time a dose is recorded, the status will show as ‘Vaccinated’ for HPV.

For details on how to upload vaccinations recorded on a spreadsheet into Mavis, see the ‘Recording vaccinations offline’ section of the user guide.
