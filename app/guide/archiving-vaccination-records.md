If you are a superuser with activity code B0062 you can remove a vaccination record by archiving it.

You may need to do this, for example, if a record appears twice due to a technical error or if historical vaccinations were matched incorrectly.

To archive a record:

1. From the Children tab of a session page, or from the global child list, go into the child record by clicking their name.
2. On the child record, scroll down to the vaccination record.
3. Click **Edit vaccination record**.
4. Select the vaccination you need to archive by clicking the date.
5. Click **Archive vaccination record**.
6. Confirm by clicking **Yes, archive this vaccination record**

If you do not have activity code **B0062** you can ask a superuser in your group to archive the record.
