You need to provide a list of schools in your area:
- when you start using Mavis
- when offering a new vaccination programme through Mavis for the first time (for example, if you only provided secondary schools previously, and now you want to offer vaccinations in primary schools)

You can do this through the link in your **Getting ready to use Mavis** email or by contacting <england.mavis@nhs.net>.

> [!NOTE]
> It’s important to include the correct unique reference numbers (URN) for each school on your list. Mavis gets the information it shows about schools (including which year groups attend the school) using the URNs you provide.

If a school has multiple sites you can state that 1 URN covers multiple sites and provide the name and address where the vaccinations will take place in the list you send us.

If you need to add or remove a school, [contact the Mavis team](mailto:england.mavis@nhs.net).

When you first access Mavis, you will see unscheduled sessions for each programme at each eligible school. If you don’t see a session that you need, contact support and we will add it.
