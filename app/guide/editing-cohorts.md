## Archiving individual child records

To remove a child’s record from the cohort, for example if:

- it’s a duplicate record
- it was imported in error
- the child has moved out of the area or died

1. Select **Archive child record**
2. Select a reason for archiving this record, adding details if required
3. Select **Archive record**

If you need to bring an archived record back into the cohort (for example, if a record was archived in error, or if the child moves back into the area), upload a cohort list again with a single row containing this child.
