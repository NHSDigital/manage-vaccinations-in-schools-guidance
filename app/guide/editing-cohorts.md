Once you have uploaded all the cohort files, you can go to the Cohorts tab and check the counts for each year group are as expected.

You can also check individual children’s records by navigating to the Children tab. However, you won’t be able to see the children listed under their school in the sessions tab until you have scheduled at least one session at that school.

Once you have confirmed that the cohort is successfully uploaded, you’re ready to start organising sessions (this is covered in the ‘Organising sessions’ section).
