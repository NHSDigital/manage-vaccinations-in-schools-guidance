Once you have uploaded all the cohort files, you can go to the Cohorts tab and check the counts for each year group are as expected.

You can also check individual children’s records by navigating to the Children tab. However, you won’t be able to see the children listed under their school in the sessions tab until you have scheduled at least one session at that school.

Once you have confirmed that the cohort is successfully uploaded, you’re ready to start organising sessions (this is covered in the ‘Organising sessions’ section).

## Archiving individual child records

To remove a child’s record from the cohort, for example if:

- it’s a duplicate record
- it was imported in error
- the child has moved out of the area or died

1. Select **Archive child record**
2. Select a reason for archiving this record, adding details if required
3. Select **Archive record**

If you need to bring an archived record back into the cohort (for example, if a record was archived in error, or if the child moves back into the area), upload a cohort list again with a single row containing this child.
