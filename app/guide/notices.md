Whenever you log in to Mavis, you should go to **Import** and then **Important Notices** to see if there’s anything you need to be aware of. These notices will also be flagged on the Mavis dashboard.

Records might be flagged as invalid if the child has 2 NHS numbers (if they’re adopted, for example).

If you see that a record has been flagged as sensitive, you need to follow this up with the child’s school and agree how to manage future contact outside Mavis.
