Whenever you log in to Mavis, you should go to **Import** and then **Important Notices** to see if there’s anything you need to be aware of. These notices will also be flagged on the Mavis dashboard.

Records might be flagged as invalid if the child has 2 NHS numbers (if they’re adopted, for example).

If you see that a record has been flagged as sensitive, you need to follow this up with the child’s school and agree how to manage future contact outside Mavis.

You should remove all sensitive and invalid records from the cohort by clicking on the child’s name, scrolling down to **Cohorts** and clicking **Remove from cohort**.
