Mavis automatically provides space for you to add notes when carrying out various tasks. 

For example, you can add:

- triage notes when reviewing answers to health questions in consent responses
- pre-screening notes when recording a vaccination
- notes on the ‘check and confirm’ page at the end point of recording a vaccination


## Adding additional notes

As well as the task-specific notes mentioned above, you can enter additional notes for a child at any point during the session.

1. Go to **Sessions** and select the relevant school session
2. Search for the child you want to add a note for, then click on their name to open their record 
3. Click on the **Session activity and notes** tab
4. Click on **Add a note**, then enter and save your note

{% from "inset-text/macro.njk" import insetText %}
{{ insetText({
  html: "Notes are visible to all users, and cannot be edited or deleted. They are not a substitute for consent, triage or safeguarding workflows."
}) }}

## Viewing notes

The **Session activity and notes** tab (described above) displays all notes entered for the child, for that session. 

The summary cards displayed on search results pages within a session include the latest ‘additional’ note for that child.
