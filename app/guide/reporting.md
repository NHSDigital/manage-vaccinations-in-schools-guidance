You can use the Programme area to download reports showing what vaccinations have been given in a specified period of time. You can share the downloads with your local CHIS team or GP practice.

You do not need to share reports for flu or HPV with GPs (except in some cases of self-consent), as [Mavis does this automatically](/guide/recording-vaccinations.md) but you still need to download and share reports with the local CHIS team.

## Download a vaccination report

To download vaccination reports:

1. Go to **Programmes**.
2. Select the programme you want to download a report for.
3. Click on **Download vaccination report**.
4. Enter a date range you want to download records for.
5. Click **Continue**.
6. Select the file format (CarePlus, SystmOne or CSV) youâ€™d like to use for the download.
7. Click **Continue** to download the report.

> [!NOTE]
> **CarePlus** and **SystmOne** format downloads only include vaccinations given whereas the Mavis **CSV** format download also includes entries for children in the cohort who were not vaccinated.

## Data sharing between CHIS, SAIS and GP practices on SystmOne

When you send vaccination records to GP practices that use SystmOne, and the local CHIS provider also uses SystmOne, these records may automatically appear in the CHIS system (subject to data sharing agreements).

If your local CHIS provider uses SystmOne, and vaccinations are recorded in Mavis for children whose GP uses EMIS Web or Medicus, you must manually extract those records from Mavis and send them to CHIS.

The same thing also applies where a SAIS provider uses SystmOne as an electronic patient record (EPR). You must manually extract data from Mavis for children whose GP practice uses EMIS Web or Medicus and upload it to the your SystmOne system.
