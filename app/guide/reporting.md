You can also use the Programme area to download reports showing what vaccinations have been given in a specified period of time, which you can share with your local CHIS team or GP practice.

You do not need to share reports for flu or HPV with GPs (except in some cases of self-consent), as [Mavis does this automatically](/guide/recording-vaccinations.md) but you still need to download and share reports with the local CHIS team.

To download vaccination reports:

1. Go to **Programmes**.
2. Select the programme you want to download a report for.
3. Click on **Download vaccination report**.
4. Enter a date range you want to download records for.
5. Click **Continue**.
6. Select the file format (CarePlus, SystmOne or CSV) youâ€™d like to use for the download.
   - **CarePlus** and **SystmOne** format downloads only include vaccinations given whereas the Mavis **CSV** format download also includes entries for children in the cohort who were not vaccinated.
7. Click **Continue** to download the report.
