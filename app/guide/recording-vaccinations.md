You can only record vaccinations for children who are registered as attending a session.

To record a vaccination (or a vaccination that didn’t happen):

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Today** tab.
3. Click on the name of the school you’re attending.
4. Click on **Record session outcomes**.
5. Go to the **Vaccinate** tab.
6. If you want to, you can filter the list by name, year group or status.
7. Click on the name of the child in front of you.
8. Once you’ve reviewed the information on the page, run through the pre-screening questions, selecting the relevant radio buttons.
9. Indicate whether you think the child is ready to vaccinate using the radio buttons at the bottom of the page.
