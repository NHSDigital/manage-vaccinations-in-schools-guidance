1. From the **Consent** tab of a session page, filter for children with **No response**.
2. Go into a child record by clicking on their name.
3. Select **Record a new consent response**.
4. Use the radio button to indicate who youâ€™re trying to get consent from (you can add a new contact if necessary).
5. Call the parent.
6. Record their response.
7. Check and confirm their answers, and select **Confirm**.
