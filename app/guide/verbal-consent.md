If you phone a parent to get verbal consent before a session starts, you can record this in Mavis.

You should also follow these steps if you’re adding a new response you’ve received through a paper form.

1. From the **Consent** tab of a session page, filter for children with **No response**.
2. Go into a child record by clicking on their name.
3. Select **Record a new consent response**.
4. Use the radio button to indicate who you’re trying to get consent from (you can add a new contact if necessary).
5. The parent’s details are displayed. Click **Continue** to enter a new consent response from that parent, then indicate whether it was given by phone, paper or in person.
6. Record their consent response and their answers to the health questions.
7. Select if it’s safe to vaccinate the child or choose one of the triage options.
8. Check and confirm the consent details and answers to health questions, and select **Confirm**.
