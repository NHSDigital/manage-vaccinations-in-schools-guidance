### About the MenACWY vaccine

The MenACWY vaccine helps protect against life-threatening illnesses including meningitis, sepsis and septicaemia (blood poisoning).

It is recommended for all teenagers. Most people only need 1 dose of the vaccine.

### About the Td/IPV vaccine

The Td/IPV vaccine helps protect against tetanus, diphtheria and polio.

It’s offered at around 13 or 14 years old (school year 9 or 10). It boosts the protection provided by the [6-in-1 vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/6-in-1-vaccine/) and [4-in-1 pre-school booster](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/4-in-1-preschool-booster-vaccine/) vaccine.

### Talk to your child about what they want

We suggest you talk to your child about the vaccinations before you respond to us.

Young people have the right to refuse vaccinations. Those who show [‘Gillick competence'](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children/) have the right to consent to vaccinations themselves. Our team may assess Gillick competence during vaccination sessions.
