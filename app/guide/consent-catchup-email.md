Our team is coming to ==location name== on ==next session dates== to give the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.

Our records show your child has not had their HPV vaccination. Pupils usually have this when they’re in Year 8.

### What the vaccine is for

The HPV vaccine helps protect boys and girls against cancers caused by HPV, including:

- cervical cancer
- some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers
- some cancers of the anal and genital areas

It also helps protect against genital warts.

The HPV vaccine works best if it’s given before young people become sexually active.

### About the HPV vaccine

Girls and boys in England are offered the HPV vaccination when they’re in Year 8.

The HPV vaccine has been given to girls since 2008. Following its success at helping prevent cervical cancers, it was introduced to boys in 2019 to help prevent HPV-related cancers that affect them – including head and neck, anal and genital cancers.

The number of doses you need depends on your age and how well your immune system works. Young people usually only need 1 dose.
