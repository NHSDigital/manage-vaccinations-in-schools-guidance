You should upload relevant historic vaccination records before scheduling school sessions. This is so you can make sure that only unvaccinated children are added to a session. (But don’t worry, if you identify that someone is already vaccinated at a later date, you can remove them from the session).

You should also include vaccination records for anyone in the cohort who was vaccinated elsewhere, if you have them. These records will be stored in Mavis and will not be sent anywhere else.

## How to import historic vaccination records

Use the following template to upload historic vaccination records. You should upload all vaccination records from the last 3 years.

{% from "attachment/macro.njk" import attachment %}
{{ attachment({
  text: "Vaccination records import template",
  summary: "Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, 18 KB",
  href: "/files/historic-vaccination-records-import-template.xlsx"
}) }}

You should upload historic vaccination records before scheduling school sessions, to ensure that only unvaccinated children are added to a session. (But don’t worry, if you identify that someone is already vaccinated at a later date, you can remove them from the session).

Vaccination record files need to be in .csv format. Records can be all in one file, or split across multiple files; Mavis is not picky about this. If you have an Excel file with multiple tabs, you will need to consolidate this into a single tab or create a separate CSV file for each tab.

For each of your vaccination record CSV files:

1. Go to the **Import** tab.
2. Click on the **Import records** button near the top of the page.
3. Select **Vaccination records**, then click Continue.
4. Click on **Choose File**, then select the CSV file you want to import.
5. Click **Continue**. If there are any validation issues, Mavis will not import the file. Correct the issues listed in the file and try again.
6. Wait for the file to finish importing

Once the file has finished importing, there may be some import issues which you need to review before doing anything else.

## Resolving issues when uploading files

Mavis will highlight any potential duplicates found in the uploaded file and compared with what was already in Mavis as an import issue.

Go to the **Import** tab. For each record under **Import issues**:

1. Select **Review**.
2. Select which version of the record you want to keep and select resolve duplicate.

If there are some parts of each that are correct, you can note down any correct information from the version you choose to discard, discard it, then go to the child’s record and manually edit the information there (this feature will be more developed in a future release of Mavis).


## Manually recording a child as 'already vaccinated'

If a child’s historic vaccination record is missing from CHIS data, or you have not been able to upload their historic vaccination record into Mavis, you can manually record the child as ‘already vaccinated’ for a specific programme. You can only do this once sessions have been scheduled (setting up sessions is covered in the ['Sessions'](/guide/sessions.md) section of this user guide).

1. From Sessions, select a session that is not currently in progress.
2. Search for the child under the **Consent** or **Session outcomes** tab - then click on the child’s name to open the child record.
3. Select the relevant tab for the vaccination programme you want to record.
4. Click on the **Record as already vaccinated** link near the top of the page.
5. Check the details on the page and add a note to explain this was a historic vaccination - then click the **Confirm** button.
