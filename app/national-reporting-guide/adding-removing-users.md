> [!NOTE]
> This section is for the Registration Authority only. If you are a Mavis national reporting user, you will be given the appropriate level of access.

Before users can access Mavis for the first time, you need to give them an appropriate role and workgroup. You can do this using the [Care Identity Management](https://manage-care-identities.care-identity-service2.nhs.uk/) service.

## Assigning a role

Give all users the medical secretary access role (R8006).

Users with this role can perform all actions in Mavis national reporting except superuser activities (see below).

### Superuser activities (B0062 and B1611)

- Local system administration (B0062) adds the ability to archive vaccination records.
- Access sensitive (S) flagged records (B1611) adds the ability to view important notices about patients who have been flagged in the Personal Demographics Service (PDS).

We recommend that there are at least 2 superusers with activity codes B0062 and B1611 per organisation.

## Assigning users to a workgroup

Each SAIS team using Mavis has a different workgroup name. Users need to be assigned to the appropriate workgroup.

You may need to [add workgroups to your organisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/care-identity-management/user-guides/managing-workgroups/create-a-workgroup) before assigning individual users.

If you create a new workgroup, you must inform Mavis by emailing <england.mavis@nhs.net>.

## Removing users

When staff leave your organisation or no longer need Mavis access, remove their access promptly through the Care Identity Management service:

- end-date their Mavis role assignment (R8006)

and/or

- remove the SAIS team-specific workgroup from their CIS2 record

This should be part of your standard leaver process for SAIS staff.
