## Finding vaccination records

3. Click on the child’s name to see their vaccination record.

You can only edit records uploaded by your SAIS team. You can view records uploaded by other teams – for example, if a child moved into your area – but you cannot edit these records.

### Adding or changing NHS numbers

Mavis will automatically replace any incorrect NHS numbers in your upload or add any missing ones found by searching the NHS Patient Demographics Service (PDS) (sometimes called ‘the Spine’) overnight.

You can also manually add or change an NHS number by editing the child’s details - see ‘Editing children’s details and vaccination records’, above.

If an NHS number is invalid, Mavis will not send that child’s vaccination record to NHS England. A superuser can identify invalid NHS numbers through important notices.
