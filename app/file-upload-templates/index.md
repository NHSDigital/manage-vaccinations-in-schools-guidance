Before using Mavis for vaccination programmes, SAIS teams must upload CSV files that include:
* full details of the cohort in their area
* relevant historical vaccination records for all children in the cohort
* up-to-date class lists from schools

You can use our file upload templates to check:
* what information you need to include
* how to format it

You can download the templates to create your own files, or view them for reference.

For detailed instructions on uploading files, see the following sections of the Mavis user guide:
* [Importing cohorts into Mavis](guide/importing-cohorts.md)
* [Adding vaccination history](guide/vaccination-history.md)
* [Importing class lists](guide/class-lists.md)
