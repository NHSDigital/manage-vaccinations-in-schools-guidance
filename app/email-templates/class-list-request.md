Dear ==name of school== 
 
We need to know which pupils are eligible for vaccination in your school so we can plan the vaccination sessions.  
 
The pupil information is usually kept in a school information management system (IMS) such as Arbor, Bromcom or SIMS. 
 
You need to send us the information in spreadsheet columns for every child: 
â€¯ 
- First name 
- Surname 
- Registration group 
- Date of birth 
- Address postcode 
- Parent 1 name 
- Parent 1 email 
- Parent 1 phone number 
- Parent 2 name 
- Parent 1 email 
- Parent 1 phone number 
 
You can also see these columns in the template attached. 
 
When choosing a time range for the data, use the 2025 to 2026 school year. 
 
You must save it as a comma delimited (.CSV) file and email it to ==email address==.

You can legally share this information with us under data protection laws, see [school immunisation programmes on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-protection-in-schools/sharing-personal-data#school-immunisation-programmes).

 
### Support 
 
Some of the common IMSs have online guides to help you get the information into the right format. For example: 
 
- Arbor has a series of web pages

- Bromcom also has web pages

- SIMS has a variety of different products, and no single web page of advice, but it does allow users to contact its support team, who can help you
