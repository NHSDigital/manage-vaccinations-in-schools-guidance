## Emails Mavis sends to parents

For scheduled sessions, Mavis automatically emails parents to:

* give information about the vaccines and ask for consent 
* send reminders if they have not responded
* confirm consent responses
* share triage decisions (where relevant)
* remind them when sessions are happening
* confirm vaccination outcomes

If we have parents’ mobile numbers, Mavis also sends them text messages.

You can see the consent request and reminder emails for each vaccination programme by selecting the relevant link in the menu on this page.

## Email templates for contacting schools

You can copy and edit these email templates to:
* request class lists from schools – this helps them send pupil information in the right format for uploading files into Mavis
* ask schools to check their details are up to date in Get Information about Schools (GIAS)
