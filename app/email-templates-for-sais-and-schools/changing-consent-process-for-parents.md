### We’re changing the consent process for school vaccinations

Dear parent or guardian,

We’re writing to let you know about a change to how you’ll be asked to give consent for school vaccinations. 

From ==month==, our local NHS school age immunisation service will contact parents and guardians directly to ask for consent. 

You’ll receive an email or text message from the NHS with a link to an online consent form. 

You can use the online form to:
- give consent for your child to be vaccinated
- say you do not want your child to be vaccinated
- update your contact details if needed

Filling in the form will be quick and easy. It’s important to respond, even if you do not want your child to be vaccinated. 

### What information we will share

To allow the NHS immunisation team to contact you, we will give them:
- your child’s name and class
- your email address and mobile phone number

These details will only be used to send messages about your child’s vaccinations.

You can find more information about the school age vaccination schedule on the NHS website.

### Keeping your information safe

Your personal data will be stored securely in line with NHS data security standards. Only authorised members of the immunisation team and the digital service team can access your contact details.

### If you have any questions

If you have questions about vaccinations or the consent form, please contact the immunisation team at ==SAIS team email==.

If you have questions about how the school shares information, please contact us.
