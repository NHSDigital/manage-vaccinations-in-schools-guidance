### We’re changing how we manage consent for vaccinations – this should save you time

Dear ==name of school==,

From ==month==, we’ll be using a new NHS digital service called Manage vaccinations in schools (Mavis) to manage our school age vaccination programmes.
 
Mavis contacts parents and guardians directly to request consent for vaccinations. This means school staff will no longer need to send out consent forms or reminders.

### What we need from you

In ==month== we’ll ask you to provide:
- class lists
- email addresses and mobile phone numbers for parents and guardians of children in each class

We’ll use these contact details to send consent requests and reminders.

You can legally share this information with us under data protection laws - see school immunisation programmes on GOV.UK.

You can find more information on GOV.UK about how schools can support vaccination programmes. 

### How we keep information secure

All personal data shared with us is stored securely in line with NHS data security standards. Only our team and authorised members of the Mavis team can access this information. It is used only to manage the school vaccination programme. 
 
Why we’re making this change 

The service will make it quicker and easier for our team to:
 
- track who can and cannot be vaccinated
- follow up with parents who have not responded
- record vaccinations
- invite children to catch-up clinics
 
Mavis is used by school age immunisation service (SAIS) teams across England. Many teams have reported higher parent response rates and increased vaccination uptake since they started using the service.  

### Telling parents about this change

You may want to let parents and guardians know that future consent requests for school vaccinations will come directly from the NHS, not from the school.

You can copy and edit this [example email template](../changing-consent-process-for-parents) if helpful.

### Questions

If you have any questions about this change, please email ==SAIS team email address==.

If parents contact the school with questions about the online consent form or the vaccination, you can direct them to our team at ==SAIS team contact details==. Our contact details are also included in the emails sent through Mavis.
