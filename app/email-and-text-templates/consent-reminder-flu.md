### About the children’s flu vaccine

The vaccine protects against flu, which can cause serious health problems such as bronchitis and pneumonia. It is recommended for children from Reception to Year 11 every year.

[Find out more about the children’s flu vaccine on NHS.UK](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/child-flu-vaccine/)

You can also find a range of [information resources about the vaccine on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flu-vaccination-leaflets-and-posters), including in other languages.

### How the vaccine is given

Most children are given the vaccine as a nasal spray. This is a quick and painless spray up the nose and offers the best protection against flu.

The nasal spray contains a small amount of gelatine derived from pigs (porcine gelatine). If your child does not use gelatine products, or cannot have the nasal spray for medical reasons, you can choose an alternative injected vaccine that has no gelatine or any other animal product. You can request this in the consent form.

### Talk to your child about what they want

We suggest you talk to your child about the vaccinations before you respond to us.

Young people have the right to refuse vaccinations. Those who show ['Gillick competence'](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children/) have the right to consent to vaccinations themselves. Our team may assess Gillick competence during vaccination sessions.
