Thank you for giving your consent for ==full and preferred patient name== to have their ==vaccination==.

Having ==delay vaccination review context==, our nursing team has decided it would be better for ==short patient name== to be vaccinated at a later date.

We'll contact you again once we have another vaccination date.

If ==short patient name apos== health changes, or you arrange for them to be vaccinated somewhere else, please tell us.

You can email ==subteam email== or phone ==subteam phone==.
