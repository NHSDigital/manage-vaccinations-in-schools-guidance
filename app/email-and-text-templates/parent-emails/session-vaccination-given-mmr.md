### Possible side effects

Your child might have some of the following side effects:

- a raised, blotchy rash (similar to a measles rash), feeling unwell, and a high temperature around 7 to 11 days after the vaccination
- swollen glands around the cheeks, neck and jaw, and aching joints (similar to a mild form of mumps) around 2 to 3 weeks after the vaccination

These side effects are usually mild and only last 2 to 3 days. If you’re concerned about your child’s reaction to the vaccine, contact your GP in the usual way.
