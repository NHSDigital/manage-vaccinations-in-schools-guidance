We’re coming to your child's school to give pupils their ==vaccination== vaccination.

^ We’re getting in touch because our records show that ==short patient name== was vaccinated at another location ==today or date of vaccination== so we’re cancelling their vaccination appointment at school.

If you think this is wrong, please let us know immediately on ==subteam phone== or ==subteam email==.

If ==short patient name== was vaccinated ==today or date of vaccination==, you do not need
to do anything.
