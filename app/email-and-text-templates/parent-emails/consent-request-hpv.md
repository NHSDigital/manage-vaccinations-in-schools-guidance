We’re coming to ==location name== on ==next session dates== to give the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine .

We would like your consent to vaccinate ==short patient name==. You can give this by filling in our online form.

^ Do not reply to this email to tell us your decision. The link to the online consent form is below.

### What the vaccine is for

The HPV vaccine helps protect boys and girls against cancers caused by HPV, including:

- cervical cancer
- some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers
- some cancers of the anal and genital areas

It also helps protect against genital warts.

The HPV vaccine works best if it’s given before young people become sexually active. Young people usually only need 1 dose.
