We have received a response to our request for consent for ==short patient name== to have their ==vaccination==.

^ We’re getting in touch because the contact details in the response are different from those we have in our records.

If you think the response was sent by someone without parental responsibility, please let us know immediately on ==subteam phone== or ==subteam email==.

If the response came from you or someone you trust, you do not need to do anything.
