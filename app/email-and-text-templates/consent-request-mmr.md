### About the MMR vaccine

The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Having 2 doses gives lasting protection against all 3 illnesses. If you’re not sure how many doses your child has had, having further doses will not cause any harm.

Research has shown there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

### Talk to your child about what they want

We suggest you talk to your child about the vaccinations before you respond to us.

Young people have the right to refuse vaccinations. Those who show ['Gillick competence'](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children/) have the right to consent to vaccinations themselves. Our team may assess Gillick competence during vaccination sessions.
