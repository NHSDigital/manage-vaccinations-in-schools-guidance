When children are taught outside their chronological year group, you need to record this in either the cohort upload or class list upload. If you do not do this, the child wonâ€™t be added to the correct cohort.

For example, for a child who would be educated in year 7 according to their birth date, but is in year 8 at school, you need to specify a value of `8` in the `CHILD_YEAR_GROUP` field in either the cohort upload file or class list upload file.
